## üöÄ Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Python 3.13+** - core programming language
- **aiogram 3** - Telegram bot framework
- **Apache Kafka** - message broker for inter-service communication
- **Redis** - caching of processed resumes and state management
- **PostgreSQL** - main database for users and metadata
- **MinIO** - S3-compatible object storage for files
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - containerization and orchestration

### AI & API
- **Claude API** - AI for processing and enhancing resumes
- **Tinkoff API** - payment solution for monetization

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project is built on a microservice architecture:

## üîß System Components

### Bot Service
- User interaction through Telegram
- Accept resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Send processing requests via Kafka

### AI Processor Service
- Integration with Claude API
- Resume processing according to prompts
- Saving processing results

### Callback Service
- Receiving resume processing results
- Sending enhanced versions back to users
- Error handling and user notifications

### Storage Service
- User data storage in PostgreSQL
- Result caching in Redis
- File storage in MinIO (S3)
- Database migrations

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Telegram Bot Token (obtain via @BotFather)
- Claude API key
- Tinkoff API keys (optional, for payment processing)

### Setup and Launch

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-bot.git
   cd resume-bot
   ```

2. Create and configure the `.env` file based on `.env.example`
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your editor
   ```

3. Launch the project with Docker Compose
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Verify services are running
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

## üìä Monitoring & Management

For monitoring and debugging:

```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View logs for a specific service
docker-compose logs -f ai_processor

# Restart a service
docker-compose restart callback
```

## üíº Business Logic

- Users get one free resume processing
- Subsequent processing costs $1
- Support for various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Different prompts for various industries and specializations

## üìù Developer's Note

This project was developed for educational purposes and demonstrates principles of building microservice architectures using modern technologies.
